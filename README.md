# Mann-s-Flight-Time-Calculation-Code
Mann's Flight Time Equation written in Java.

This is an equasion I developed with the assistance of a Friend during our first year of Computer Science at University in London.

## The Equasion Inputs.

---> Departure Date.

---> Departure Time.

---> Arrival Date.

---> Arrival Time. 

---> Time Difference *(Based on the difference from departure time.)*


## The Equasions Assumptions.

---> The Flight between two locations is direct with no stops or changeovers.

---> The Flight Information prodivded includes the **Arrival** _and_ **Departure** time.

---> The Flight Times Provided are based on the 24 hour timing convension.


## Future Developments. 
I am currently working on a GUI version of this flight time calculator being developed in Java using Java SWING for the GUI.
I have almost finished the GUI design and will begin the process of incorporating the data inputs and calculations. 
This should be completed in a week or so.
